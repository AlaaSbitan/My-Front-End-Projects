            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Web accessibility is about ensuring that websites are usable by
              everyone, including people with disabilities. By making your site
              accessible, you not only comply with legal standards but also
              reach a broader audience. This post explores the importance of web
              accessibility, guidelines and standards to follow, and practical
              techniques to implement in your web design.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Accessibility Matters</h2>
            <p>
              Accessibility is crucial because it allows individuals with
              disabilities to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with
              the web. It also benefits others, such as older people with
              changing abilities due to aging. Moreover, accessibility
              improvements often enhance the overall user experience.
            </p>

            <h2>Guidelines and Standards</h2>
            <p>
              The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a
              comprehensive set of recommendations for making web content more
              accessible. These guidelines are organized into four principles:
              Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR).
              Following these principles ensures that your site is accessible to
              a wide range of users.
            </p>

            <h2>Techniques for Accessibility</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Semantic HTML:</strong> Use semantic HTML elements
                (<code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, etc.) to
                provide meaningful structure to your web pages.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Alt Text for Images:</strong> Provide descriptive alt
                text for images to assist screen reader users in understanding
                the content of images.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Keyboard Navigation:</strong> Ensure that all
                interactive elements (links, buttons, forms) are accessible via
                keyboard alone, without requiring a mouse.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Color Contrast:</strong> Maintain a high contrast ratio
                between text and background to ensure readability for users with
                visual impairments.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>ARIA Landmarks:</strong> Use ARIA (Accessible Rich
                Internet Applications) landmarks to improve the navigation
                experience for users of assistive technologies.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensure your website is
                mobile-friendly and usable on various devices, which also aids
                users with different needs.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Testing for Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
              Testing is a critical part of ensuring accessibility. Use
              automated tools like WAVE, Axe, and Lighthouse to identify
              accessibility issues. Additionally, manual testing with screen
              readers (such as NVDA or VoiceOver) and keyboard-only navigation
              can uncover issues that automated tools might miss.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Building accessible websites is not just a legal requirement but a
              moral obligation to ensure inclusivity for all users. By following
              guidelines and implementing practical techniques, you can create
              web experiences that are accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
              Embrace accessibility in your web design process to make the
              internet a better place for all.
